CAPSTONE PROJECT: COLMAR ACADEMY

INTRODUCTION
------------
Today you will begin work on your capstone project, a landing page for the fictional Colmar Academy. This project is meant to be your biggest challenge yet, so as always, make sure to work on it in reasonable pieces and commit your work each step of the way.

As you apply your skills in this project, you might notice similar design features on different parts of the site. Take the time to map out your strategy for these sections ahead of time so you don't lose time copying and pasting code. If you do find yourself writing extremely similar pieces of code, don't be afraid to go back and refactor them into one single reusable piece of code. This will make your code easier to read and use and will save you time when debugging.

We've provided you a week to complete this project. Use this time to make informed design decisions and craft clean, readable code. Before you dive into this project, we recommend you map out what work you are aiming to accomplish each day. This will set you up to create a product you are proud of by the end of the week. Additionally, days where you fall short of your goals (which will happen) will help you identify places to keep practicing and reviewing in the future.

We're excited for you to create this capstone project and can't wait to see your final product. Good luck!

INSTRUCTION
-----------
You are tasked with designing and creating the landing page for a new school. You will help them by making informed design decisions about color and typography using the skills you learned last week. You will then implement your design.

For this project we will provide you with wireframes. A wireframe is a document which contains the positioning of the elements on a page without specifying any other design information. This allows designers and developers to focus on the flow of a site without getting distracted with design decisions such as color and typography. These aspects of the design are important, but when they are introduced too early, they can detract from other important decisions.

For this project you will implement the site specified by the wireframes and make all remaining design decisions to complete the site. You can find the wireframes for this project here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/capstone-2/colmar-academy-spec.png) and all of the necessary assets for the project here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/capstone-2/capstone_colmar_assets.zip).

Good luck!
